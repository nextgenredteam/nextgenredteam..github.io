				</h4>
                <p>
					A penetration test simulates the activity of an attacker in order to identify problems in your organization before they are exploited by hackers. Using NextGen Red Team's testing services, you can simulate both external and internal threats to your organization. A team of subject matter experts with real-world experience possessing industry-leading offensive security certifications performs the testing against your infrastructure, applications, and employees. NextGen Red Team also offers Red Teaming and network risk assessments to enhance your cybersecurity posture.

                <p>
					The first step in creating a security-conscious culture, modifying behavior, and implementing the "human firewall" is to identify your employees' susceptibility to attack. With our simulated phishing, social, physical, and USB attacks, we measure your organization's and your employees' susceptibility without exposing them to real threats. You can significantly impact the security of your network, data, and reputation through your employees' reactions to these types of threats. Based on your organization's industry-specific needs, NextGen Red Team will design mock scenarios and security awareness training programs.

					Penetration Testing
				</h4>
                <p>
					A NextGen Red Team penetration test distinguishes itself by looking at the bigger picture. Through our approach of not limiting ourselves to one set of controls (network, application, physical, system) to defeat, we are able to simulate a real attack scenario. A true attacker will not stop if the front door of your network is locked and neither will we.
